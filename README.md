# Homework 3: Word-Guess-Game

## Details:

- With this project I created a word guessing game, with a world cities theme.  This hangman style game allows you 10 guesses to figure out a World City.
- Click on a letter to make a guess.  If you are correct it will start to fill in the blanks.  If you are incorrect you will lose a life.
- To win you must fill in all the correct letters before you lose your last life.

## Homework Instructions:
- Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
- Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
- Display the following on the page:
- Press any key to get started!
- Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

- Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

- Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

- After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
